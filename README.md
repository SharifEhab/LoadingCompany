# LoadingCompany
This project is about loading company .
A loading company has trucks and cargos and those trucks should deliver those cargos .
Throughout their delivery trip the trucks goes from loading to moving to checkup and back to the company.
By applying data structures such as linked lists , queues , and priority queues we were able to implement a program where you can watch the process of cargo delivery.
